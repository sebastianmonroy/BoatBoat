HOW TO PLAY:
	Goal:
		Get to the hidden treasure while surviving the perils of the sea!
	Players/Controls:
		A maximum of four players work together to perform different jobs aboard BoatBoat. Each player is controlled with a separate controller. The player can move around the deck of BoatBoat with the left control stick. The player can mount any station by standing within a colored zone and pressing A(xbox)/X(psx). At any time a player may dismount from that station by pressing B(xbox)/O(psx).
	Jobs/Zones/Controls:
		Rowing (Purple Zone):
			Standing in a purple zone and mounting allows the player to begin rowing. By moving the left and right sticks the player changes the position of the oars. Pushing the oars through the water moves BoatBoat relative to the direction the player is rowing!
		Cannons (Red Zone):
			Standing in a red zone and mounting allows the player to man the cannons! The player can load the cannon by pressing X(xbox)/[](psx), and fire the cannon by pressing RightTrigger(xbox)/R2(psx)! The faster the player presses reload, the quicker it reloads! The player can also slightly change the aim of the cannons. By holding down on the left stick the cannon aims higher, and by holding up on the left stick, the cannon aims lower. The cannon can also swivel left and right a short amount via left and right on the left stick.
		Lookout (Green Zone):
			Standing in a green zone and mounting allows the player to become the Lookout! This player can use the left stick to rotate the camera around, and help get a better understanding of the area around BoatBoat. This can be used to help the manned cannons, or look for enemies sneaking in from the rear!
	

MEETING REQUIREMENTS:
	It must be a game!
		- The play can complete the level by surviving and reaching the treasure chest!
		- The player sinks if too damaged and prompted to start over!
		- The player able to restart!

	Character Controller with Real Time Control
		- The player has control of the character at all times.
		- Choice of controls is very intuitive and lifelike.
		- Controls are fluid.
		- Offer dynamic range of control, especially in oar rowing job.

	3D World with Physics and Spatial Simulation
		- Graphically 3D with open world exploration
		- Auditory 3D sound generation locations.
		- Interactive with environment. (Cannonballs push backwards, ship and terrain bumping move the player)

	Real-time NPC Steering Behaviors/AI
		- AI has 5 states used.
		- Logically patrols, chases, and hunts down the player.

		- Realistic rowing controls.
		- Particle effects for every type of collision.

		- Anywhere between 1 and 4 players active at any time.
		- Toony art direction.
		- Lack of glitching (that we're aware of).

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
	Controller is required! Most gamepad controllers are accepted!
	All controllers to be used in gameplay session must be plugged in and ready prior to loading the webpage. 
	If a controller disconnects during gameplay, the controller must be reconnected and the page refreshed in order to reset the controller settings ingame.
	It's possible you might need to reinstall the InControl plugin from the above GitHub link, but we've only had issues with that when syncing on different coomputers with version control.

WHO DID WHAT:
	This project was completed using a Divide-and-Conquer approach. Sebastian wrecked with the algorithm and code writing for most of the project. Chase was fantastic with handling all of the models imported into the game through googlesketchup and into unity. Cole handled code writing with Sebastian (but not as much), but also a lot of the work outside of development, such as writing all of the READMEs as well as filming, videoediting, and producing the Game Trailer. Cole also found a large selection of the sounds used and implemented them into the game. Chase designed several of the particle explosions, from scratch. Jory was vacant from the development process for the majority of the semester. He added very little to the final product, and anything he did develop was not used, as his lack of communication resulted in the rest of the team already having implemented this feature into the project.
